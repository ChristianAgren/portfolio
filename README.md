# portfolio

### Description:
Welcome to my digital portfolio! I made this page to write a little about myself and to present my future projects.

For now the page lacks certain things, such as actual projects I have been working on. That will be changed in the future when I have more background to refer to.

It was important that the page represents me and what I take interest in, which is why I chose to make it in a single-page configuration where I can structure as much information as possible without overwhelming you. The theme is space, as it is something I've always found interesting. I wanted the page to represent my creative side, and I hope that the graphical aspect of the page makes the picture clear.

Thanks for stopping by!
